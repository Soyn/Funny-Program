I remember when we broke up, the first time.
saying this is it I’ve had enough. 　
cause like we hadn’t seen each other in a month. 　
when you said you needed space…what? 
Then you come around again and say. 
baby I miss you and I swear I’m gonna change. 
trust me. 
remember how that lasted for a day? 
I say I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you. 
Oh Woo-Oh
